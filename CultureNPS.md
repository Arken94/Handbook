When it comes to people on the Walkthrough team, we have two main goals as an organization:
1. Recruit & retain top talent. 
2. Create an environment where team members can do their best work.

<br><br>
Our hypothesis on things needed for a team member to do their best work include:
- A positive & transparent environment
- Autonomy 
- Purpose
- Personal Growth

<br><br>
Today, the questions we ask to determine how we’re doing are:
1. How long have you been with Walkthrough?
    1. <1 month
    2. 1-6 months
    3. 6-12 months
    4. 1-2 years
    5. 2+ years
2. On a scale of 1-10, how positive & transparent do you feel the team is at Walkthrough? 
3. On a scale of 1-10, how much autonomy do you feel that you have in achieving company goals?
4. On a scale of 1-10, how excited are you about Walkthrough and what we're disrupting in the Real Estate Industry?
5. On a scale of 1-10, how much personal growth do you feel at Walkthrough?

<br><br>
If you have any suggestions, we’d love to hear them!
