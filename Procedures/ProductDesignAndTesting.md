# Product Design & Testing Process
Here is the initial way we approach product design, testing & implementation. This will continue to get more detailed over time and we're open to any thoughts and feedback to this process!

## Process
1. Declare your problem statement. What is the big problem we are trying to solve?
1. Declare your assumptions using the assumptions worksheet
1. Create hypothesis statements
    1. We believe that….
    1. We will know we are right/wrong when we see the following feedback from the market….
1. Interview users
1. Create user personas for each user
    1. Sketch and name
    1. Behavioral demographic
    1. Pain points and needs
    1. Potential solutions
1. Create a customer journey map using assumptions and user profiles, as illustrated here: https://drive.google.com/open?id=13CbRK7rRFpSd0EDyvI2DjjlOytK2TnEr
    1. Document with steps here
1. Create an information architecture from the customer journey
1. From the IA, develop low fidelity wireframes for the product, mapping out the screens which match the customer journey
1. Review wireframes with team
    1. White board new ideas and flow as needed
1. Revise low fidelity wireframes based on team feedback from meeting
    1. Review with team to be sure flow and architecture is dialed in
1. Review wireframes with 3 users for feedback
1. Create high fidelity prototype using InVision
    1. UI team to collaborate on design features, animations, and color based on the brand guide
1. Review high fidelity prototype with team and make revisions
1. Review high fidelity with 3 users
1. Test high fidelity prototype with real users in the field
    1. Record responses and observations using this form: 
1. Code
1. Test internally
1. Beta launch to predefined users
1. Measure initial results
1. Iterate
1. Launch to all users
1. Measure monthly and quarterly using this procedure
