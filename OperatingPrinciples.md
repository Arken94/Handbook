## Principles:

1. **A good system shortens the road to the goal.** - Systems are at the heart of everything we do.  Living in systems ensures a high level of consistency and quality which leads to less waste.  If you have an improvement or a faster, cheaper or more efficient way, let us know.  Our best ideas come from those who are “in the trenches” everyday. We take the necessary time to create and implement systems for recurring problems. On the other hand, we don’t create processes for “Once-in-a-while” situations. <br>

2. **Customer service is not a department, it is an attitude.** - When we have wronged a customer, always give them the choice of choosing at least two different options to make it right.  We come up with the choices, but empower the customer to make the decision. They are our livelihood, without them we don’t earn an income. We do whatever it takes (up to $200) to make a customer happy. Whether that is find another company to provide the service for them, give a refund, or to switch things around to make their desires happen. 

3. **Metrics are for doing, not for staring** - We never measure something just because we can.  We measure to learn and to fix.  On the flip side, we won’t fall into the trap of ONLY doing what get’s measured.

4. **Mistakes** - It’s better to let everyone know loud and clear when you’ve made a mistake than for someone else to find out. 

5. **Punctuality** - We don’t waste anyone else’s time. Whether that’s attending meetings late or delivering late. We value and respect each others time. 

6. **Mission & Team** - We work with each other not for each other. We are all here to achieve the same mission and every critique, hire or the process of letting someone go are all in the act of making a better team.

7. **Evidence Based Strategy** - There are a lot of opinions about what does and doesn't work. Suggestions and recommendations should be backed by some kind of evidence or data. If there is none, we can run a test.

8. **Move fast, break things** - Where systems are not in place, we create MVP’s and get the first version down as quickly as possible to continue improving our systems. We’ll never have a perfect system without it living in the wild, so the goal is to have this happen as quickly as possible. 

9. **Take Ownership** - If your system failed or you didn’t follow procedure, you step in and do what it takes to right the wrong as quickly as possible.

10. **Architects not Firefights** - We are not firefighters (although we need to do this from time to time). We are architects. We don’t manage problems; we work on systems in order to prevent problems from happening in the first place. We simplify. Many times eliminating of a system, protocol, or project can be a good thing. We refine to the smallest amount of steps. Our systems are designed to be “Off-The-Street” meaning, anyone with the required skills for a role could pick up a procedure and follow it. 

11. **Deadline Obsessed** -  If someone in the organization says they will be finished with a task or project by a certain date, they they fully commit to finishing their project by that deadline (or if legitimate delays intrude, advise workers well in advance that the deadline is impossible).

12. **Environment** - Physically it is clean, ordered, simple, efficient & functional. 

13. **We avoid multitasking activities** - We give full attention to the person in front of us (or the task at hand).
