If you need to submit a bug issue or feature request to the dev team, here is how:

## Via Slack ##

Since most of our company communications happen over Slack, it makes sense to accept tickets that may arise in conversation here. If you need to submit one, ideally you would form your ticket like so:

Ticket Format: 

```
Given I am a <the role of the user>
When I <perform a particular action>
Then I <state the expected result>
```

It takes a little practice to get used to structuring your issues in this way, and we also encourage you to discuss the issue naturally and we can help you construct the ticket if you need help.
