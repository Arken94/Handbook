# Explaining Equity
Our goal is for every team member joining Walkthrough what the equity part of their compensation package means and understand how it may effect their decisions in the future. This document will cover: 

- What is equity?
- Salary vs Equity
- Vesting
- Dilution
- Example Acquisition Scenarios
- Options vs Equity
- Common Questions
- Additional Resources




## What is equity?
Equity is a form of compensation that startups use in order to bring on and retain top talent team members. Having equity in a company means that you have a stake in the business you’re helping to build and grow. You’re also incentivized to grow the company’s value in the same way founders and investors are. Investors buy equity in a company with money, but you’ll be earning it through your investment of time and effort. 

Equity is a tool that startups use to:

- **Align team members & founders** - Unlike at a corporation where you may not receive any real benefit from working outside of your 9-to-5, at a startup, every hour you put in should translate in more equity value in your pocket. 


- **Save their most precious resource of cash** - If a startup had 4 team members take a salary of $80k instead of $100k, the team could afford to hire 1 more person. In theory, the company should be able to achieve more with another person on the team, already making their equity more valuable. 

- **Align team members to stay for the long haul.**


## Salary vs Equity
In general, salary is a safer bet, it’s money that you’ll get guaranteed every month, so choosing higher salary will give you an immediate benefit of more cash in the bank up front.

Equity has more risk, as it’s not guaranteed that Walkthrough will sell. 
From our side, we love it when team members choose an equity option over additional salary but we understand it depends highly on the circumstance of each individual people (for example families, new bought houses, and other more immediate financial responsibilities are often a reason for people to choose higher salary).

## Vesting
There is a ‘vesting schedule’ that we follow, it’s designed in a way to reward those who stay for the long haul. Ours is a four year vesting schedule, which basically means after working four full years, all of the equity will be officially vested (meaning: yours). 

Here are the details of what it looks like:

- Year 1 - 10% vested after first 12 months (if you leave before these first 12 months, you don’t keep any of your options).
- Year 2 - 20% vested over the following 12 months (you vest 1.66% of your option grant monthly)
- Year 3 - 30% vested over the following 12 months (you vest 2.5% of your option grant monthly)
- Year 4 - 40% vested over the following 12 months (you vest 3.33% of your option grant monthly)

If there is any liquidation event, like us selling or IPO’ing or so before you’re fully vested through the schedule, you will automatically vest in all your shares.  

The are a few scenarios where that may not be the case such as if that clause is revoked in an acquisition offer. If that’s the case, we’ll be sure to let everyone on the team know what we’re working with.

####  Why does the 1 year cliff exist?
The reason this exists is so that no one “tricks” us into just getting some equity, through for example joining for just a month, and then quitting. We don’t have a feeling that that would ever happen and have full trust in our team members, it’s just a longstanding legal precaution that we’ve felt makes sense to adopt. It also gets really messy as it takes time to know whether someone is a fit in the first few months and quite a few people end up leaving Walkthrough before the 1-year mark, so doing paperwork around equity if someone was only here 2-3 months would get messy quickly.



- As an illustration, if you were to leave after 2.5 years, that is (12+12+6) months = 30 months spent at Walkthrough, (10% + 20% + 15%) you will be granted 45% of your equity.


## Dilution
If Walkthrough raises more money from outside investors there’ll be a dilution for you. That means if we raise more money, say 10 million whilst being valued at 100 million – 10% will go to investors. So now only 90% is left for the rest of us who are owning stock/options, which means you’d have to multiply your existing options by 0.9 and you’d lose 10% of your value of the options.

In theory, even though your options are considered a smaller percentage than before the investment, the company is now more valuable and has fresh cash to continue building, expanding, and create more value. 
## Example Acquisition Scenarios
In general, choosing more equity means taking more risk. But a small change in equity can mean a big change in monetary outcome. So we also share with each team member a few examples of exit scenarios for Walkthrough. 

For example, let’s look at someone with options for 0.5% of Walkthrough:

- Walkthrough sells for $50M. They make $280,000.
- Walkthrough sells for $500M. They make $2,800,000.
- Walkthrough sells for $1B. They make $5,600,000.

Keep in mind, these figures would have to be adjusted for any additional dilutions and deducted by the amount the employee pays for the options (for example $0.002/share if they are an early employee at Walkthrough) and any taxes that apply. So in the $280,000 example, effectively with those deductions it would become ~$245,000.

The way the number $0.002/share or $0.37/share is determined is through an outside firm valuing Walkthrough through a process called a 409a valuation. They come up with the price/share which can then be used to issue options for all Walkthrough employees. Every company has to do a new 409a valuation once a year.

## Options vs Equity
What a team member actually gets when joining Walkthrough is a number of options in Walkthrough, not actual equity. 

An option, as defined by Wikipedia, means the following:

```an option is a contract which gives the buyer (the owner) the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying asset or instrument at a specified strike price on or before a specified date.```

Say Walkthrough has 1,000 shares and is valued at $1000. When you join Walkthrough, you get 10 in options as part of your compensation package. This means you get the right to buy all 10 options at a fixed price after your options have vested. Let’s say that price is $1. So if you want to get your 10 Walkthrough shares, you will pay $10 and then you will hold 1% in the company. Now, let’s say Walkthrough sells the company to Google for $10,000, which is 10x the original value when you joined. Since you have 10 options, you can pay $10 for your 10 shares, and since Walkthrough just sold, you will get $100. Effectively, you will make a $90 profit – that’s a pretty sweet outcome!

The older Walkthrough gets, the more valuable the company (hopefully!) becomes. So the fixed price to pay for the options also go up. As an example, when Walkthrough started, the first few people could pay $0.002/share. The next batch, after Walkthrough became more valuable, had to pay $0.37/share. So the difference between option price and the worth of the actual share went down slightly – it should always be so that it’s still very worthwhile to have these options.

## Common Questions
- **What is Walkthrough’s exit strategy?**
	- We’re here for the long haul. Many startups have a goal to be acquired relatively quickly and although we would entertain offers, our goal is to build one of the greatest real estate technology companies of all time. 

- **What if someone leaves Walkthrough before an exit or liquidity event?**
	- So far, we’ve had a number of people leave Walkthrough after they had vested some of their stock options already. Since the valuation of the company was still fairly low, it was only a few hundred or a couple of thousand dollars for them to exercise their stock options on the way out.
