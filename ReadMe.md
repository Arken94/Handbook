## Welcome to the Walkthrough Handbook

Throughout this page you’ll be able to see and read through all of the publicly available documentation we have on the company. We do this because:

1. By sharing openly, we often receive feedback and make our processes better.
2. Prospective candidates can look through how our company is run to see if they’d fit within our culture.
3. We help other people build great companies by replicating & modifying our documentation.

Please send us comments & feedback as you read through the documentation to pascal@getawalkthrough.com. This is the only way we get better as a company. Enjoy!
