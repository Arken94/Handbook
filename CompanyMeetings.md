Walkthrough currently has 3 official meetings that we use as a team to make sure we're all on the same page as a company. 



## Fortnightly Sprint - 10am-12pm MST every other Monday


##  Daily Standup - 10am-10:30pm MST every day but not when we have sprint
1. Write daily update & make sure your asana tasks are up to date - prior to 10a
1. Read everyone’s responses, ask clarifying questions
1. Review Asana tasks
1. Review OKR
1. Where are we & What can each of us do today/tomorrow to get closer to our goal?



## Existential - 10:30am-12pm MST every other Friday

This is where we discuss topics that we may not be aligned on. This may include: 
* I don’t think we should be build X, maybe we should build Y. 
* I’m struggling with building a great customer service team, can we afford to do X?
