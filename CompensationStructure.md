At Walkthrough, one of the ways we express our “Transparency” values is by being as open as we can about compensation. This not only includes existing hires but those we aim to attract. 

Our hope is that by making our compensation model transparent, we build trust amongst our employees and allow new hires to decide if our opportunity is right for them. Candidates know exactly what they are getting themselves into when they apply and we avoid the awkward negotiation dance at the end of the interview process. 

We’re constantly revisiting our model but here it is for now: 

## Compensation is calculated by:
Base x Influence x Salary Choice + Benefits

<br><br>
## How our salaries are calculated:
### **Base Salary** 
We use Salary.com as well as GlassDoor.com to get an initial salary base for all roles. <br>

<br><br> 
### **Influence** 
Rather than focus on "experience" or "tenure", we prefer to give our team members much more actionable ways of advancing themselves in the organization.

<br><br>

### **Salary vs Equity Choic**e 

- New team members after their first month of employment, have the choice of either choosing more salary or more equity. <br>

### Benefits:
**One-time:**
* Up to $1,500 reimbursement for computer upgrades (new laptop, upgrading computer parts) & to create the best working environment (monitors, standing desks, etc)


**Annually:**
* 100% of health insurance covered under our insurance policy through Gusto or up to $700/mo in reimbursement towards a health care provider of your choosing
* 28 Days Paid Time Off - Because team members may celebrate different holidays, we roll up paid time off and vacation time together. You may choose to work on Labor Day, so you should have the choice to take a different day off. 

**Additional Benefits:**
* Buy any audible or kindle book on the company account

## What is not included:
* Location - Today we do not adjust salaries based on where a person lives. 
* Dependents


## Things we don’t take account of today which we’d like to solve:
* Taxes - For example if you live in a country where taxes are closer to 40-50% of your earnings. 
* Exchange rate changes - Because we’re a distributed team, if the exchange rate works in your favor that is obviously a good thing. What happens when the exchange rate drops?
* Loyalty - Should a teammate  with us at Walkthrough, automatically receive a pay raise of 5% every year? 


** Thank you to Buffer for being so open about their compensation model which is where we've built the base of our compensation model. **
